Resilio Sync (formerly BitTorrent Sync) is a peer-to-peer file synchronization tool available for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Amazon Kindle Fire and BSD. It can sync files between devices on a local network, or between remote devices over the Internet via a modified version of the BitTorrent protocol. 

## Initial Setup

Installing Resilio is easy. Simply issue the following command from SSH:

```bash main
sudo box install btsync
```

This command will configure and install btsync for your user.

## How to Access

After Resilio Sync has been configured for your user, the application can be accessed from your web browser at `https://<domain.ltd>:8888/gui`

## Service Management

The systemd service for btsync is an override for the default one shipped with the application. The swizzin file lives at

```bash
/etc/systemd/system/resilio-sync.service
```

import SystemdTabs from '../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx';

<SystemdTabs service="resilio-sync"/>
