We often need the community's help to test new applications. As the whole tool set is tracked in git, you can try new features quite easily.

Anyway, if you're courageous enough, here's how you can test the latest and coolest stuff!

## Using the `develop` branch

We have two update rings. `master` (the default branch) is extremely closely monitored for stability, and our `develop` branch is used to put new bleeding edge features out in the open.

You can seemlessly transition between `develop` and `master` at any point by running the commands below.

```bash
sudo box switchbranch develop
```

Please note that going from `develop` to `master` will _not_ remove any changes that were applied while on `develop`. While we believe you should have no issue going in this direction, we cannot guarantee it 100%. Check with us in the discord if you face any issues when doing this.


## The branch checkout dance

:::warning Watch the fuck out!
Please make sure you only do this if you know what you're doing. A poorly written installer could easily destroy your entire machine beyond any hope of repair. If you do not know how you would get out of a completely broken install, do not attempt these steps!
:::

There are two types branches you might want to test. One that is made by the swizzin team, and one that is made on a repository forked from swizzin.

As soon as you're on the branch you need to be on, you just keep using `box` just like you usually would. Just watch out for `box update`s! read more about those [below](#preventing-updates).

### Branches on the swizzin repo

You can run the following commands to get onto a branch of a PR.

```bash
box branchswitch <name of PR branch>
```

Switching back to `master` or develop **will not be prevented** so make sure that you know what you're doing!

### Branches from any fork

Now this is a little more hands-on as you need to add the remote fork to your repository, but this can be done quite easily with the GitHub CLI tool.

You can install it quite easily by installing it from the [instructions here](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md#debian-ubuntu-linux-apt)

After installing, make sure to run the following, and make sure to use the `HTTPs` mechanism when asked.

```bash
gh auth login
```

When you've got that done, you can just go browse to the specific PR you'd like to test, and find the `gh` code to use it in the "Open In" menu. This code will look like this for example

```bash
gh pr checkout 401
```

## Getting back to the master/stable branch

All you need to do is run `box update`, and you will be back right on track!

**HOWEVER**, none of the changes you made to swizzin can be undone. Make sure to remove any other apps or features which are not supported on the main repo, and reinstall them again when they're merged, or if there have been new commits on the beta branch since you updated.

If you are unsure what is safe to do, please ask the author of the branch to provide you with instructions on how to get back.

### Preventing updates
If you'd like to make sure that you do not go back to the master branch until you are ready, please read the [section on updating](setup#updating-mechanism).
