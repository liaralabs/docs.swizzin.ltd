`box` is a homegrown application that will help you install applications on your server and manage their services.

## Introduction
In order to use the installer and management functions on your slot, you'll need to use the included management script: `box`.

`box` has several functions, which we'll go over here:
- help
- install
- remove
- update
- upgrade
- adduser
- deluser
- chpasswd
- panel fix-disk
- list

:::tip Tip
Since `box` is considered a complete box management script, its functions require root/sudo permissions to execute. The guide will assume that you're either a root user or prefixing the commands with `sudo`

## box
When run alone, box will start a graphical user interface with install and remove functions similar to the initial setup.

Syntax:
```bash
box
```

## help
The function of help is basic: provide you usage details on how to use box and the commands available to you.

Syntax:
```bash
box help
```

## install
The function used to install applications from the server. If you need help with specific commands, they are available on the application sub-pages here. You can specify as many applications is you like here.

Syntax:
```bash
box install rtorrent deluge
```

## update
This function can be used to update your swizzin repository. There are a number of update scripts that trigger each time this command is called -- these will typically help fix issues or upgrade your current installation to a new method of handling the application in question.

Syntax:
```bash
box update
```

## upgrade
This function can be used to upgrade a specific application to a newer version or recompile an application which was compiled during install. Only selected applications have upgrade scripts. You can check which scripts have `upgrade` components by looking in the `/etc/swizzin/scripts/upgrade` directory. Call them directly by name.

Syntax:
```bash
box upgrade nginx
```

## adduser
The function used to add a secondary user to your server. Please note, only the master user has access to a significant portion of the included applications

## chpasswd
Use this command when you'd like to change your password. `chpasswd` will change the password for SSH, FTP, HTTP and Deluge. You must specify a username as well.

Syntax:
```bash
box chpasswd forgetfulfriend

## panel fix-disk
Use this function to change your quota directory from root to home. This fixes a potentially incorrect disk reporting in the panel. The command accepts two options: `home` and `root`.
