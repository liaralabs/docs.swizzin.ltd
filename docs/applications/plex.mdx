Plex media server allows you to aggregate all your personal media and access it anywhere you go.

## Initial Setup

First you must connect to your slot via ssh. If you need help connecting to the server, please read the help article [here](../getting-started/how-do-i-connect.md).

Installing Plex on your slot is easy. Simply issue the following command:

```sh
sudo box install plex
```

### Automatic claiming

As of v1.6.0, swizzin now supports claiming your server during the installation. When you install Plex, you'll be greeted by the prompt:

```wrap
Please visit https://www.plex.tv/claim, login, copy your plex claim token to your clipboard and paste it here. This will automatically claim your server! Otherwise, you can leave this blank and to tunnel to the port instead.
```

Simply visit [the link](https://www.plex.tv/claim) to grab your claim code and paste it into the terminal. After Plex is installed, the script will use the claim code to grab a valid token for your user and apply it to your server.

If for some reason you didn't claim during installation, you can still run the command manually from SSH.

First we must source the Plex functions called during installation:

```bash
. /etc/swizzin/sources/functions/plex
```

Then we can call the function directly:

```bash
claim=<your plex.tv/claim code>
claimPlex ${claim}
```

The function will run and if all goes well, you'll receive a `success` message stating that your server as been claimed under your account.

### Manual claiming

After installation, you'll need to create an SSH Tunnel to your server to appear as if you're using the same network as your Plex instance.

If you've gotten this far, I'll assume you don't need any reminders on how to connect to the server via SSH ;) However, creating an SSH tunnel takes a bit more effort than simply creating an SSH Connection.

## Connect to other clients

If you need to link your Plex instance to another application, such as Sonarr or Tautulli, you can use the following details:

```plaintext main
Host: 127.0.0.1
Port: <your plex port>
```
