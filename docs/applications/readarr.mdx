Readarr is a ebook (and maybe eventually magazine/audiobook) collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new books from your favorite authors and will grab, sort and rename them.

:::danger
Readarr is in the early stages of development and is considered alpha.
Please make sure to check in the [Readarr Discord](https://discord.gg/rkEXY2Rbgn) about any issues you might face with the **application**.
Anything else can go into the swizzin discord.
Install and use with caution.
:::

## Initial Setup

Installing Readarr is easy. Simply issue the following command:

```bash main
sudo box install readarr
```

This command will configure readarr for your user.

## How to Access

After Readarr has been installed, it will be available for access at `https://<hostname.ltd>/readarr`.

If you don't use `nginx`, you can find it on port `8787`.

## Service Management

The Readarr service is managed by systemd and has been configured for single user usage. You can find the service file here:

```
/etc/systemd/system/readarr.service
```

import SystemdTabs from '../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx';

<SystemdTabs service="readarr"/>

## Configuration

Out of the box, Readarr comes with no configuration. Following are some basic tasks to help get your client up and running:

### Add a new book (and your first root directory)

1. At the top, click Library.
2. Click `Add New`
3. Type the name, ibsn, or asin of the book or author's name that you want to add
4. In Root Folder choose `Add a new path`. Enter the path for the folder you wish to add your Readarr books to.
  - e.g. `/home/<username>/media/books`
5. Change the other settings to your own needs
6. Click the green `Add {book/author}` to add the book/author.

### Connect download clients
import Conn4Arrs from '../snippets/conn4arr.mdx';

<Conn4Arrs />

### Add an indexer with Jackett
Readarr only supports a few trackers out of the box, but the indexers can be expanded by using the application [Jackett](jackett.mdx). To add an indexer with Jackett, use the following steps.

:::note
By default, when receiving the torznab feed from Jackett, it will need to be modified to be connected with the application. The default link looks like:

```plaintext
https://<yourhostname.ltd>/jackett/api/v2.0/indexers/yourtracker/results/torznab/
```

We need to edit this link to **remove https** and **add the port number**. Thus, if your port number was `12345`, your edited URL would look like this:

```plaintext
http://<yourhostname.ltd>:12345/jackett/api/v2.0/indexers/yourtracker/results/torznab/
```
:::

1. Go to `Settings > Indexers` and click `+` to add a new indexer.
2. Under `Torrent` choose `Torznab`
3. Use the settings:
```plaintext main
Name: <tracker name>
URL: <click copy torznab feed in jackett and modify as per above>
API: <copy and paste from jackett UI>
```
4. Click `Test`. If all is good, click `Save`.

### Other tasks

You may wish to further alter your setup by setting quality profiles or setting up post-processing so that media is automatically transferred to your Readarr library when your torrents or usenet are completed. 
If you need further help, you can refer to the [Readarr Wiki](https://wiki.servarr.com/Readarr) and [Readarr FAQ](https://wiki.servarr.com/Readarr_FAQ)/

   
If you are not running Readarr as your master user, you can set the environment variable `readarrOwner=<yourUser>`before the update, and the migration will respect the choice.
