## Snippets
We are keeping a lot of reusable code in the `.vscode/*.code-snippets` files.

These give you auto-completions within VSCode and its derivatives, and have pre-defined fields which you can tab-through in order to skip to the next ones.

There _should_ be snippets available for all of the functions declared in `global.sh`.
