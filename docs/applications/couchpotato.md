Download movies automatically, easily and in the best quality as soon as they are released, via usenet or torrents.

## Initial Setup

Installing CouchPotato is easy. Simply issue the following command from SSH:

```bash main
sudo box install couchpotato
```

This command will configure and install CouchPotato for your user.

## How to Access

After CouchPotato has been configured for your user, the application can be accessed from your web browser at `https://<domain.ltd>/couchpotato`

During installation, the files were placed in your home folder: `~/.couchpotato`

## Service Management

The couchpotato service is managed by systemd. The systemd service file uses the multi-user format, but the service is not configured for any user other than the master.

The systemd service for couchpotato resides here:

```bash
/etc/systemd/system/couchpotato@.service
```

As the service utilizes the multi-user format, you must specify a username along with the command.

## Configuration & Usage

### Connecting Clients

Out of the box, CouchPotato supports a number of downloader options that can be used with swizzin: blackhole, nzbget, sabnzbd, rtorrent and deluge. It should be fairly straight forward to set them up for use with CouchPotato

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--Blackhole-->
::: panel
```
Directory: where you would like CouchPotato to send torrent files/nzbs
```

Then in your torrent client, configure the same directory as a watch directory. Your client will automatically add items in this folder to your client.
