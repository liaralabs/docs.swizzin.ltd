Ombi is a self-hosted web application that automatically gives your shared Plex or Emby users the ability to request content by themselves! Ombi can be linked to multiple TV Show and Movie DVR tools to create a seamless end-to-end experience for your users. 

## Initial Setup

Installing Ombi is easy. Simply issue the following command from SSH:

```bash main
sudo box install ombi
```

This command will configure and install ombi for your user.

After installation, the files are stored in `/opt/Ombi` and the configuration and database are stored in `/etc/Ombi`

## Upgrading

Ombi is installed and maintained by the unofficially provided repository. In order to keep ombi up-to-date, update your packages with:

```
sudo apt -y update
sudo apt -y upgrade
```

### Upgrading to v4
:::warning
At the time of writing, v4 is not stable. That is why v3 is the default install, although it is EOL.
Once v4 becomes Stable, the default installation will no longer install v3.
This method will persist for the convenience of upgrading from v3 to v4.
:::
:::warning
Please make sure to make backups in case you would like to downgrade. You can find out how to do this on the [Ombi Wiki](https://github.com/tidusjar/Ombi/wiki/Backups)
:::
You can install the v4 through the _other_ unofficially provided repository by running the following command.
```
box upgrade ombi
```
The upgrading procedure on v4 is the same as above, i.e. through the use of `apt`
