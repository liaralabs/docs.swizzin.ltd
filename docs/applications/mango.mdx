Mango is a CBZ viewer with an integrated MangaDex downloader and plugin support for other services.

## Installation

You can install mango by issuing the following command:
```bash
sudo box install mango
```

## Accessing Mango
You can access Mango using `domain.tld/mango` if you have `nginx` installed. Otherwise, it is available on `domain.tld:9003`

### Retrieving files

As the media library for mango is shared, it is located under `/opt/mango/library`. This directory is accessible to all users of the server.

## Service Management

The Mango service is managed by `systemd` and has been configured as a system application. You can find the service file here:

```
/etc/systemd/system/mango.service
```

import SystemdTabs from '../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx';

<SystemdTabs service="mango"/>

## User management

Mango manages its users in a separate database to `box`. However, `box` will automatically add, remove and update users and their passwords into Mango when you use the `box` user commands (such as `adduser`, `deluser`, and `chpasswd`). You can still manage users through thee Mango admin interface, and create mango users that are not managed by box at all.
